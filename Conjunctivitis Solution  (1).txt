Model performance result for PCT classification
The binary classification approach and the multiclassification approach for eye disease significantly differed (p=0.037). The model's overall diagnostic performance in binary classification achieved 100% accuracy. Precision, recall, and F1 scores are also perfect. This indicates flawless discrimination between conjunctivitis and healthy eyes. In the confusion matrix, 33 test samples correctly predicted conjunctivitis, and 25 predicted healthy eyes.

Fig. 3 Binary classification training and validating accuracy and loss
 
The training log provided in Fig.3 shows the model's performance for 20 epochs. During training, accuracy of the training dataset increases steadily, eventually reaching 99.5%. The training loss also decreases, which indicates effective learning. The accuracy of the validation set approaches 100%. This shows that the model is able to generalize to unknown data. Validation loss is also reduced, indicating that the model minimizes errors both during training and validation. This is indicative of a successful binary classification.

Fig. 5 Multi- classification training and validating accuracy and loss
 
The log of training in Fig. 5 gives an insight into the performance of the model over 20 epochs. There is a noticeable reduction in training and validation loss, which indicates effective learning. Similarly, accuracy improves steadily, reaching 98.51% on the training set and 100% on the validation set. As epochs advance, the learning rate decreases. These trends indicate successful model training and robust generalization of unseen data.
 
Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1 score
Table 1 shows metrics for accuracy, precision, and recall of the machine learning model in predicting eye diseases. The model performed well in the multiclassification task, which included five categories: "atopic conjunctivitis," "healthy eyes," "viral conjunctivitis," "uveitis," and “bacterial conjunctivitis." The accuracy, precision, and recall of the test were all higher than 98%. And the F1 score for this model was 98.69%. The confusion matrix showed that the model correctly classified every category.
The model performed flawlessly when asked to distinguish between "healthy eye" and "conjunctivitis." Test accuracy, precision recall, and F1 scores were all 100%.
